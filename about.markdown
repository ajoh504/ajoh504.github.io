My name is Alex Johnson. I'm a software enthusiast currently learning programming. I created this site to document my journey in doing so. The topics you'll find here may include any of the following: algorithms, data structures, programming language features, and software engineering concepts.

I am not an expert on the subjects presented here. My goal is simply to write articles as a way to test my knowledge on what I'm learning.

Sites I follow:

- [PCjs](https://www.pcjs.org/)
- [Fabulous Adventures in Coding](https://ericlippert.com/)
- [Better Explained](https://betterexplained.com/)
- [Advent of Computing](https://adventofcomputing.com/)
- [SS64](https://ss64.com/)

This blog is hosted using [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
