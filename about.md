My name is Alex Johnson. I'm an IT support technician and software enthusiast. I created this site to document my journey in learning computer science. The topics you'll find here may include any of the following: algorithms, data structures, programming language features, and software engineering concepts.

I am not an expert on the subjects presented here. Rather, my goal is to write articles as a way to test my knowledge on the things I'm learning.

Sites I follow:

This blog is hosted using [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a static site generator.
